The INDIAN Government’s decision to name Abdul Malik Institute of Science and Technology Patna as the sole provider of Home Economics Teacher Education in INDIA (2003) and the Department of Health’s approval of the new School of Nursing and Health Studies has resulted in a dramatic increase in student numbers in the past five years. Current student numbers attending the College are approximately 45000.<br><br>

The provision of such a range of academic offerings at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels coupled with its unique geographical position as the sole provider of University education in the North West has lead to a dramatic increase in student numbers regionally and nationally with an ever increasing interest internationally. It is predicted that there will be a significant growth in student numbers over the next few years.<br><br>

<h2>The Modern Day Campus & Environment</h2><br>
